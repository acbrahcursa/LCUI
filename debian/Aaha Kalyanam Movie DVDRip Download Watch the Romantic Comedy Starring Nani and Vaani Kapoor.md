The film revolves around Shruti (Vaani Kapoor), an ambitious and quirky wedding planner, and Shakthi (Nani), a street-smart and fun-loving guy who joins her as a partner. Together, they start a successful wedding planning business called 'Getti Melam', but things get complicated when they fall in love with each other and break their own rule of not mixing business and romance.
 
The film is a light-hearted and entertaining watch that showcases the colorful and vibrant culture of weddings in South India. The chemistry between Nani and Vaani Kapoor is refreshing and charming, and Simran adds a touch of glamour as a famous wedding planner who mentors Shruti. The film also has some catchy songs composed by Dharan Kumar, such as 'Mazhaiyin Saaralil', 'Kadha Kadha' and 'Honeyae Honeyae'.

The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics and audiences alike. The Times of India gave it 3 out of 5 stars and praised the script, the direction and Nani's performance, but criticized Vaani Kapoor's lip sync and the lack of Tamil nativity. [^1^] The same rating was given by the Telugu version of the same newspaper, which also appreciated Nani's charm and wit, but felt that Vaani Kapoor was a mismatch for him. [^2^]
 
Filmibeat gave it 2.5 out of 5 stars and called it a "good comedy entertainer" that can be watched by family members, but also noted that it may not impress the Telugu viewers due to its Tamil scent. [^3^] IMDb users rated it 5.8 out of 10 based on 507 votes, with some users enjoying the film as a light-hearted and entertaining watch, while others finding it boring and unoriginal. [^4^]
 
Aaha Kalyanam was not a big success at the box office, grossing around Rs. 22 crore worldwide against a budget of Rs. 10 crore. [^1^] It was overshadowed by other releases such as Gunday, Highway and Darr @ The Mall in India, and The Lego Movie, RoboCop and Pompeii in overseas markets. However, it did manage to recover its costs through satellite rights and digital streaming deals.
  
The film also received some recognition at various award ceremonies. It was nominated for two Filmfare Awards South in 2015, for Best Actress (Vaani Kapoor) and Best Playback Singer Female (Chinmayi) for the song 'Mazhaiyin Saaralil'.  However, it did not win any of them. It also received a nomination for Best Debut Director (Gokul Krishna) at the Vijay Awards in 2014, but lost to Nalan Kumarasamy for Soodhu Kavvum.
 
Aaha Kalyanam is a film that tries to capture the essence of a successful Bollywood rom-com and adapt it to the Tamil and Telugu audiences. It has its moments of fun, romance and drama, but also suffers from some drawbacks such as the casting, the music and the lack of regional flavor. It is not a bad film by any means, but it is not a great one either. It is a film that you can watch once and forget about it, or maybe watch it again if you are a fan of Nani or Vaani Kapoor.
